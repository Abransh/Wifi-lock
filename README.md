# Wifi-lock

This is a code to for Arduino uno R$ with in built esp32 and bluetooth 

Here, I made a project to help myself in a real life situation. 
So, If you use Arduiono iot app, 

assign a boolean switch,

so when you turn the button the servo turns 40 degress which could be used for any purpose, you have to just figure out how to use it.
My personal use case was pushing a button which opens my apartment lock.
